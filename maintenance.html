                    </div>
                <div class="mission">
      <p id="blurb">Whether you built your own Chicken Coop or bought a readymade or kitset Coop, you do need to care for your coop to ensure your chickens remain safe from the elements, protected from predators and healthy. Be sure to check your chickens and coop at least once a day and if you are going away have someone check it for you.</p>
        
        
        <div>
        <h3>Regular Perimeter Checks</h3>
        <p>Be sure to regularly check the perimeter of your chicken run to ensure no predators can get in (or indeed no chickens can slip out!). Also, check the chicken coop itself to ensure it is still robust and there is no split material or weathered wood that may begin to cause issues.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
        <h3>Check the Feeders and Watering</h3>
        <p>Ensure your feeders continue to be accessible to your chickens. They can get moved, particularly as your flock grows and you may need to adjust the height. You should check these daily, and make sure you clean them at least once a week. Water should also be checked daily, particularly in temperature extremes to ensure that it has not frozen and there is sufficient in the hot weather. A chicken will drink little and often. Ensure the water supply is fresh and clean and like the chicken feeders clean and disinfect this at least once a week.</p>
        </div>
      <div>   <h3>Check all doors and hatches</h3>
        <p>Chicken coop doors and hatches should be checked daily given their high use. These can be easily secured with bolts or latches, however if your door is starting to come off the hinges, you should replace either the hinge or the door itself as you don't want your chickens to take flight!
</p>
     </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Clear the Poop from your Coop</h3>
        <p>Regularly remove the buildup of chicken poop. This is actually very good manure for your garden due to its high nitrogen and phosphate content. If left, flies and other parasites will be attracted to it and your coop will develop an unhealthy smell.
