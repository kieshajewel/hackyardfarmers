                    <h2>FAQ</h2>
                    </div>
                <div class="mission">
                   <div class=”faq”><h3>Should I buy pullets or straight run chicks?</h3>
<p>Pullets have been sexed by the hatchery and are usually sexed 90% accurately. Most hatcheries or feed stores will refund your money or buy back the cockerels which exceed 10%. Straight run chicks are usually less expensive, but they are 50% pullets and 50% cockerels (more or less).</p></div>

<div class=”faq”><h3>When can my chicks go outside?</h3>
<p>You should wait until they are fully feathered to put them outside.  Depending on the temperature, they can go outside when they are from 5 to 12 weeks old. </p></div>

<div class=”faq”><h3>Will racoons hurt my chickens?	</h3>
<p>Yes. Raccoons are one of the most common predators of chickens. They will attack mainly at night, and can tear a bird apart very quickly. They frequently will kill more than one. Good secure coops will help to protect your flock from racoons</p></div>

<div class=”faq”><h3>How many eggs will my hens lay?</h3>
<p>On the average, 3 hens will give you 2 eggs a day. That means to get a dozen eggs a day, you would need 18 hens.</p></div>

<div class=”faq”><h3>How long do chickens lay eggs?	</h3>
<p>Chicken can lay eggs into their teens, although they sometimes stop earlier.</p></div>

<div class=”faq”><h3>When will my hens start to lay eggs?</h3>
<p>Most hens start to lay around 4-6 months of age, more or less.However, for various reasons (time of year, temperature, etc.) they may wait until the next Spring to start laying eggs.</p></div>

<div class=”faq”><h3>My hen chickens are laying thin-shelled eggs. What do I do?</h3>
<p>Try giving them oyster shells - the calcium helps keep the shells thick and strong. </p></div>

<div class=”faq”><h3>How long does it take to hatch an egg?</h3>
<p>About 21 days.</p></div>

<div class=”faq”><h3>What breed should I get?</h3>
<p>Decide what you want from your chickens. If you want them for eggs, you should get a breed that lays a lot of eggs. If you want them for meat, you should get a breed that grows heavy at a young age. If you want them for pets, you should get a breed that is calm and easy to handle. </p></div>

<div class=”faq”><h3>What is the best breed for laying eggs?</h3>
<p>Leghorns, Rhode Island Reds, Australorps and Orpingtons are all very productive breeds.</p></div>

<div class=”faq”><h3>Will my hens lay eggs if I don't have a rooster?</h3>
<p>Yes. A hen only needs a rooster in order to lay fertile eggs that could hatch</p></div>


<div class=”faq”><h3>How many roosters do I need for my chickens?</h3>
<p>One rooster for every 8-12 hens will probably produce fertile eggs.</p></div>

<div class=”faq”><h3>What is coccidiosis?</h3>
<p>A protozoa in the droppings, easily spread from chick to chick. Cocci can be prevented with medicated feed. Older chickens can be treated with Corrid or Albon. Usually readily available at most feed stores.Usually readily available at most feed stores. Cleaning the feeder and waterer at least daily is an important step in the prevention and treatment.</p></div>

<div class=”faq”><h3>What is the best way to introduce new chickens to an already established flock?</h3>
<p>Separate newcomers and established birds with a barrier (i.e., wire), so they can see each other but not directly interact for a period of 1-4 weeks. This will help keep fighting to a minimum. Always introduce them while SUPERVISED, so you can control any fighting.</p></div>

<div class=”faq”><h3>How long do chickens usually live?</h3>
<p>Most people say up to 10 years or more if they stay healthy. We have one hen, still laying, that is five years old.</p></div>

<div class=”faq”><h3>When meat chickens are ready for processing, can you take them somewhere to have them done or do you have to do it yourself?</h3>
<p>Yes you can take them to processors to be killed and cleaned in most areas. Contact your local Poultry Club to find out if there is someone doing that as a business near you.</p></div>
